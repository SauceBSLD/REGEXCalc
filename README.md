# REGEXCalc
A calculator using JS regex and recursion

Handles simple operators ( + - * / ) and parantheses, also prioritizes the right calculations, check console to see the details of every calculations. 
Still a Work in Progress, more bugs/features to improve (support nested parantheses, prioritize the right nested parantheses, handle more operators, etc)
